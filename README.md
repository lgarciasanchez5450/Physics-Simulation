Context:
This was used a Math and Science Academy project during our Junior Year to help people visualize more complex conepts with regards to gravitational motion.
This program can accurately recreate Kepler's second and third laws. It can also look at the universe from the perspective of any planet to help people grasp how perspective can differ from reality.
